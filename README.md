# Friday Night Funkin' Lore Engine
Psych Engine with some neat tweaks.

Extra features include:
- Improved frame rate counter
- Aesthetic improvements
- Hitsounds
- Basic support for two vocal tracks (still sorta buggy)
- More to come!

NOTE: If you're running on Linux, please use the official Linux build instead of running the game through Wine. FNF has quite a few input, stuttering, and minimization issues with Wine at the moment.

use haxe 4.2.4 bozos
